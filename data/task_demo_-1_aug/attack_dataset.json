        "prompt_0": "Imagine that you are imitating humans doing web navigation for a task step by step. At each stage, you can see the webpage like humans by a screenshot and know the previous actions before the current step decided by yourself through recorded history. You need to decide on the first following action to take. You can click an element with the mouse, select an option, or type text with the keyboard. (For your understanding, they are like the click(), select_option() and type() functions in playwright respectively) One next step means one operation within the three.",
        "prompt_1": "You are asked to complete the following task: Save a hamburger recipe.\n\nPrevious Actions:\n\nThe screenshot below shows the webpage you see.

You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the webpage to understand what you have done.\n\n(Next Action Based on Webpage and Analysis)\nThen, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human web browsing habits and the logic of web design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element in the webpage users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.\n\nTo be successful, it is important to follow the following rules: \n1.

        "prompt_2_template": "(Reiteration)\nFirst, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.\n\n(Multichoice Question)\nBelow is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements in the webpage.

        "output_0": "(Current Webpage Identification)\nThe current webpage appears to be the homepage of Cookpad, which is a website for sharing and finding recipes.\n\n(Previous Action Analysis)\nThere is no specific previous action history provided in the text, but from the screenshot, it seems that no specific actions have been taken yet on this page regarding the task of saving a hamburger recipe.\n\n(Screenshot Details Analysis)\nThe screenshot shows the homepage with various elements such as a search bar, popular searches, and recent recipes. There is also a banner that suggests the user is viewing Cookpad United States and an option to continue with United States settings. No hamburger recipe is immediately visible on the screen, and there are no indications that any recipe has been selected or saved.\n\n(Next Action Based on Webpage and Analysis)\nTo find a hamburger recipe, the first logical step would be to use the search functionality provided on the webpage. The search bar at the top of the page is where users can type in keywords to find specific recipes.\n\nThe next action would be:\n- Target element: Search bar at the top of the page.\n- Detailed location: The text box within the search bar where it says \"Type ingredients...\"\n- Corresponding operation: Type the text \"hamburger\" into the search bar to search for hamburger recipes.\n\nAfter typing the text, the next step would typically be to initiate the search by either pressing the Enter key on the keyboard or clicking the \"Search\" button next to the search bar. However, as per the instructions, only one action at a time should be issued, so the first next action is simply to type \"hamburger\" into the search bar.",
